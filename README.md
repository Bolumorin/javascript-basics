6. Difference between Statically and Dynamically typed language:
   A language is statically typed if the type of a variable is known at compile time. For some languages this means that you as the programmer must specify what type each variable is. Examples include : Go, Scala, C ,C++ , etc.
   WHILE
   A language is dynamically typed if the type is associated with run-time values, and not named variables/fields/etc. This means that you as a programmer can write a little quicker because you do not have to specify types every time. Examples : Perl, Ruby, JavaScript , PHP, etc.
   Difference between null and undefined data type:
   Null means an empty or non-existent value. Null is assigned, and explicitly means nothing. Null is also an object
   WHILE
   Undefined means a variable has been declared, but the value of that variable has not yet been defined.
